The yaffs2utils is the collection of utilities to make/extract a YAFFS2/YAFFS1
image for Linux.

Currently, it inclueds the following tools:
(1) mkyaffs2: making a yaffs2 (yaffs1) image 
(2) unyaffs2: extract a yaffs2 image made by mkyaffs2.

This project is developed under the Debian Linux 5 (code Lenny). It can make a 
yaffs2 image to be ran under my embedded system (Linux 2.6.20), and extract a 
yaffs2 image made by itself. 

Making a yaffs1 image to be ran properly is NOT verified since I don't have an 
embedded system device with the old NAND flash (512k page). I will be glad if 
someone can help me to verify the integrity to make a yaffs1 image.
